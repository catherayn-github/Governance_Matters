                Our findings suggest that, despite the expected significance of corporate governance and audit quality, we found no substantial effect between corporate governance, audit quality, and investment efficiency among listed holding companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2023. This lack of a significant impact underscores the complexity of governance structures and points to the need for further exploration of other factors that may influence investment efficiency. We believe that variables such as macroeconomic conditions, market volatility, or firm-specific characteristics could play a more prominent role, which warrants deeper investigation.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                Given these results, we recommend that future studies focus on alternative factors or models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of investment efficiency. Exploring elements such as corporate culture, leadership dynamics, and industry-specific regulations could provide valuable insights. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more granular analysis of governance mechanisms beyond ownership concentration, board size, and audit committees, as this could uncover overlooked variables that might enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance in driving investment efficiency.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                Finally, we recognize the importance of improving the depth of audit quality assessments and examining how they are applied in different market contexts. By doing so, we can gain a better understanding of how audit practices interact with governance structures to shape business outcomes.

                As researchers, we recognize that the key takeaway from this study is the intricate and multifaceted relationship between corporate governance, audit quality, and investment efficiency. While corporate governance and audit practices are undeniably critical components of a company’s operational framework, our findings reveal that their direct impact on investment efficiency, particularly when mediated by audit quality, may not be as significant as initially anticipated.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                The observed fluctuations in investment efficiency, coupled with improvements in audit depth stemming from longer auditor-client relationships, highlight both the potential and the limitations of current governance reforms. These results suggest that while efforts to strengthen governance practices and audit frameworks are crucial, they may not fully address the challenges of optimizing investment efficiency on their own.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                This study underscores the need for us to look beyond traditional governance metrics and audit quality measures. There is a clear necessity for stronger, more adaptive governance frameworks that account for the dynamic nature of business environments. Similarly, we must refine audit practices to ensure they effectively complement governance efforts in driving investment efficiency.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                We also recognize the importance of expanding research into other influential factors that may shape investment efficiency. For instance, macroeconomic conditions, market volatility, corporate culture, leadership dynamics, and industry-specific regulations could all play a significant role. Exploring these variables could offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms that influence investment outcomes.
              </p>
              <p   class="discussion-para">
                Additionally, we advocate for a more granular approach to analyzing governance structures. Examining factors beyond ownership concentration, board size, and audit committees—such as the role of independent directors, board diversity, and stakeholder engagement—may reveal overlooked elements that enhance governance effectiveness.
              </p>
              <p class="discussion-para">
                Lastly, we see value in improving the assessment of audit quality by considering its application in varying market contexts. Understanding how audit practices interact with governance structures and external variables will be essential in designing systems that promote both accountability and efficiency. By addressing these areas, we aim to contribute to the development of governance and audit practices that not only bolster investor confidence but also drive sustainable and efficient investment outcomes.
