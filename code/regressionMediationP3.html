        <h4>Effect of Corporate Governance on Investment Efficiency Through Audit Quality</h4>

        <p class="details-card-text">
            Effective corporate governance is crucial for driving investment efficiency, long-term financial sustainability, and shareholder value. Audit quality plays a key role in this relationship by enhancing the reliability of financial reporting, reducing information asymmetry, and aligning governance mechanisms. This minimizes managerial inefficiencies and supports strategic investments. 


        </p>
        <P class="details-card-text">
            Studying how corporate governance and audit quality jointly influence investment efficiency is essential but underexplored due to the complexity and data demands of such research. While these areas are well-studied individually, their combined analysis offers a unique opportunity to address a critical research gap and advance understanding in this field.

                        The mediation analysis examines the relationship between corporate governance and investment efficiency, with audit quality as a mediator, using the Baron and Kenny framework. The total effect shows no significant impact of corporate governance on investment efficiency (<strong>p = 0.7873</strong>). Similarly, the direct effect, accounting for audit quality, is not significant (<strong>p = 0.6710</strong>). The indirect effect, evaluating audit qualityâ€™s mediating role, also fails to show significance (<strong>p = 0.1512</strong>). Overall, corporate governance does not significantly influence investment efficiency, either directly or through audit quality.

                    <p class="details-card-text">
                        Due to the limited number of research studies investigating the mediating effect of audit quality on the relationship between corporate governance and investment efficiency, no existing study explicitly concludes that corporate governance lacks a significant impact on investment efficiency when mediated by audit quality. However, the researchers' analysis suggests that audit quality may fail to mediate this relationship in holding firms due to their distinct structural and operational characteristics.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="details-card-text">
                        Holding firms manage diverse subsidiaries with decentralized decision-making, limiting the direct impact of parent-level corporate governance on investment efficiency. Audit quality, while ensuring financial reporting accuracy, often struggles to bridge governance and investment outcomes due to the varied structures and regulatory environments of subsidiaries. Industry-specific practices can reduce the consistency and effectiveness of audit quality as a mediator, making strategic oversight and internal controls more critical in such firms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="details-card-text">
                        However, prior studies highlight the importance of audit quality in linking governance to investment efficiency. <strong>Soliman (2020)</strong> and <strong>Javed & Qazi (2024)</strong> emphasize that strong corporate governance improves audit quality, enhancing transparency and resource allocation. High-quality audits bolster investor confidence and amplify governance effects on investment efficiency. Similarly, <strong>Shazly et al. (2022)</strong> find that audit quality mediates governance and investment decisions, reinforcing its role in supporting informed and efficient investment processes.
